# Artificial_neural_network_from_scratch
A simple neural network / multilayer perceptron classifier built with NumPy.

Classifies random generated data in a pattern similar to the XOR-problem.
Applicable to a wide range of data sets by slightly augmenting the code. Works for an arbitrary number of features, layers, and neurons.

run in cmd by the following code:

python NN.py

only library requirements are numpy and matplotlib
