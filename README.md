# Artificial_neural_network_from_scratch
NN.py is a simple neural network / multilayer perceptron classifier built with NumPy.

ex.py includes random generated data points from a Gaussian distribution.
Classifies random generated data in a pattern similar to the XOR-problem.
Applicable to a wide range of data sets by augmenting the code. Works for an arbitrary number of features, layers, and neurons.

It is possible to further improve the classifier's (NN.py) performance in certain classification tasks by implementing another cost function such as cross-entropy, as well as different activation functions, like the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU).

run in cmd by the following code:

python ex.py

only library requirements are numpy and matplotlib
