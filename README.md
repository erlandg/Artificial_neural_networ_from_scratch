# Artificial_neural_network_from_scratch
A simple neural network / multilayer perceptron classifier built with NumPy.

Classifies random generated data in a pattern similar to the XOR-problem.
Applicable to a wide range of data sets by slightly augmenting the code. Works for an arbitrary number of features, layers, and neurons.

It is possible to further improve the classifier's performance in certain classification tasks by implementing other cost functions such as cross-entropy, as well as different activation functions, like the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU).

run in cmd by the following code:

python NN.py

only library requirements are numpy and matplotlib
